# UniTween

UniTween is a Tween framework that is based on DOTween and Odin. But why should you use it?

* **Zero-coding:** Make simple or complex tweens only by working on the Unity Edity.
* **Productivity:** In our tests it is around 10 times faster to create a tween using UniTween than coding it.
* **Price:** Unlike DOTween Pro (paid license per seat), UniTween is free and can do much more without coding!

## How To Install
* Import DOTween to your project (version 1.1.640 or higher)
* Import Odin - Inspector and Serializer to your project (version 1.0.6.1 or higher)
* Download the latest .unitypackage file [from the Packages folder](https://github.com/sampaiodias/UniTween/tree/master/Unity%20Packages) and open it on your project.

## Special Thanks
