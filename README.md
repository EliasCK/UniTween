# UniTween

UniTween is a personal Tween framework for the games I make (mainly mobile games). It is based on DOTween and Odin.

## How To Install
* Import DOTween to your project (version 1.1.640 or higher)
* Import Odin - Inspector and Serializer to your project (version 1.0.6.1 or higher)
* Download the latest .unitypackage file [from the Packages folder](https://github.com/sampaiodias/UniTween/tree/master/Unity%20Packages) and open it on your project.

## Special Thanks
* [Sirenix](http://sirenix.net/odininspector/) for their amazing support for Odin
